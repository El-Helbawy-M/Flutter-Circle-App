This file is created for crateing the constant values and constructing the theme of the app

================= Rules =================
 1- For anu variable you will need to follow this style:
    * chosse the class that is releated to the data type that you
      want to add.
    
    * add the new variable as a <static> <const> <variable>.
    
    * name it in small charcters.
    
    * follow the guide rules of the comments and write a comment for the new
        variable.
    
    * the format of the variable : (static const <variable name> = <value> ;)
    
 2- Soon...

================= Notes =================
Main color : for some widgets like the containers or app Bar or any thing that takes a big space on the screen

Background Color : for the backGround of the screens or the button or dialogs

Second Color : for braking the domenation of the main color like of you have an app bar and it's color is white
then you can break the app bar's color with blue as a second color in icon button or title text and so on
